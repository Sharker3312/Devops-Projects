    “Ability to design implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines”

Suggested steps

    Research and choose a CI/CD tool. You’ll want either a SaaS CI/CD service with a free tier you can use for learning, or a self-hosted tool. If you choose self-hosted, you’ll need to deploy the tool (extra credits if you do this!)

    Find a project on GitHub, preferably a web application so that you can interact with it using a web browser. We recommend Spring Petclinic which is a Java web application developed in Spring Boot, but use any other project you’re familiar with.

    Fork the project into your personal GitHub account.

    Write a pipeline for your CI/CD tool, to test, compile & package the application. Run the pipeline in the CI/CD tool.

    Extend the pipeline to deploy it to a server (this is the “CD” part). You’ll need to research to learn how the application is deployed.

What you’ll get from this project

CI/CD is the bread-and-butter of DevOps. This project will get you to pick up a CI/CD tool, and write a pipeline of your own. (💎 Check out our article on the common stages in a CI/CD pipeline →)

You’ll understand the concepts of CI/CD, get experience in configuring one tool, and writing a pipeline.

There are lots of choices available for CI/CD; from Jenkins to GitLab, from GitHub Actions to Concourse. The choice can seem overwhelming.

Pick a commonly-used tool (researching job ads will help you figure that out) and run with it. The most important thing is not to memorise every command or feature, but to get experience and understand the terminology.
For extra credits 🎓

    Add code quality checking. Add a stage to your pipeline which checks code quality, using Sonarqube or another open source or free tool.

    Add a manual approval stage. Add a stage to your pipeline which requires a manual approval before deploying to production.

    Deploy an app which comprises a separate frontend and backend (so, two pipelines)
