# Create and run a CI/CD pipeline for an app  #

![](/home/sharker3312/Descargas/Workflow.png)

`Suggested steps📋:`

- ➡️Research and choose a CI/CD tool. You’ll want either a SaaS CI/CD service with a free tier you can use for learning, or a self-hosted tool. If you choose self-hosted, you’ll need to deploy the tool (extra credits if you do this!)
	
- ➡️Find a project on GitHub, preferably a web application so that you can interact with it using a web browser. We recommend Spring Petclinic which is a Java web application developed in Spring Boot, but use any other project you’re familiar with.
	
- ➡️Fork the project into your personal GitHub account.
	
- ➡️Write a pipeline for your CI/CD tool, to test, compile & package the application. Run the pipeline in the CI/CD tool.
	
- ➡️Extend the pipeline to deploy it to a server (this is the “CD” part). You’ll need to research to learn how the application is deployed.

` For extra credits 🎓`
- ➡️Add code quality checking. Add a stage to your pipeline which checks code quality, using Sonarqube or another open source or free tool.
  
- ➡️Add a manual approval stage. Add a stage to your pipeline which requires a manual approval before deploying to production.
  
- ➡️Deploy an app which comprises a separate frontend and backend (so, two pipelines)
